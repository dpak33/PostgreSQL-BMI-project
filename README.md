# PostgreSQL-BMI-project
This flask-based web application allows users to enter various pieces of information into a user-friendly interface on a web-based server.
The information is then stored securely in a PostgreSQL database to which I have access via PGAdmin. My python script then works on
the data inputted into our application (height, weight, email and age) before emailing the user relevant data as well as their BMI, as
well as some related information concerning average BMIs for men and women in the user's age category. Once the user has entered
their information, they are taken through to a success webpage with further links to associated BMI-and-health-related information.
The project demonstrates understanding of the SQL language, secure databases and rudimentary understanding of front-end languages,
including HTML and CSS.
